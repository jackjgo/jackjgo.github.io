On August 25th, 2021, I successfully defended my thesis titled: Comparing UAV and Pole Photogrammetry for Monitoring Beach Erosion. As of September 14th, the Virginia Tech Graduate
School officially approved my final thesis document, thus fulfilling all requirements for my MS in Geography. You can read the entire document [here](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/104997),
or look below for the gist of my thesis project.

## Introduction

Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry has been widely used for geomophology research and surveying in aborad range of environments. SfM uses a series of overlapping images from a any digital camera to identify matching points in sequential images and construct a 3D model of a subject. For topographic applications, a high aerial perspective is desired, such as that from an aircraft or tall platform. Between advancements in software and consumer drone technology, SfM and drones have emerged as an excellent platform for rapidly generating accurate and high resolution point clouds and digital surface/elevation models, at a lower cost than comparable technologies like lidar or terrestrial laser scanning. In a sandy beach evironement, this can be especially useful as waves, tides, and especially large storms constantly move sand around. However, drones do have some limitations, mainly due to governement regulations and weather, which can totally restrict flight. For example, FAA regulation prohibits flight over crowded areas, making UAV-based surveys impossible on popular beaches without totally restricting access to the beach. To work around flight restrictions, a camera can be mounted on a tall pole to gain a similar aerial perspective, and promises to be a viable solution to the limitations of UAV-SFM.
