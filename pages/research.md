I'm currently involved in a few research projects, generally focused around coastal hazards and emerging geospatial technologies.

The first is my Master's thesis, titled Comparing UAV and Pole Photogrammetry for Monitoring Beach Erosion. This project examines UAV-based structure from motion photogrammetry,
and an alternative terrestrial approach that promises to solve some of the limitations surrounding UAV flight. My final thesis is pubished on [Virginia Tech' ETD database.](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/104997) I'm currently working on adapting my thesis for publication in a relevant journal.

Connected to my thesis, I'm also working with a couple of other researchers to explore pole-based photogrammetry more broadly.

As a Graduate Research Fellow in NCAR's Early Career Innovators Program, I'm a co-author on several papers in various stages of the drafting and submission process exploring responses to coastal flooding and relocation on the US East Coast. Stay tuned while these publications roll out!
