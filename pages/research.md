I'm currently involved in a few research projects.

The first is my Master's thesis, titled Comparing UAV and Pole Photogrammetry for Monitoring Beach Erosion. This project examines UAV-based structure from motion photogrammetry,
and an alternative terrestrial approach that promises to solve some of the limitations surrounding UAV flight. My final thesis is pubished on [Virginia Tech' ETD database.](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/104997)
