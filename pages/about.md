Hello! My name is Jack GOnzales, and welcome to my website, which I created to showcase my work and share a little more about myself. 

I'm a soon-to-be alumnus of Virginia Tech's Geography MS program, and as of September 2021, I have fulfilled all degree requirements, and have only to wait until commencment to officially graduate. I'm currently searching for employment, so if you are looking for a talented young remote sensing or geospatial analyst, I'm your man!

Currrently, I'm living in my hometown of Charleston, South Carolina. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my first love, the water, singing with my church choir, or gettting lost somewhere in the marsh or the forest.({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2016-10-10-getting-started %}).
