# Hello! 
My name is Jack Gonzales, and welcome to my website, which I created to showcase my work and share a little more about myself. 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackjgo/jackjgo.github.io/gh-pages/assets/img/remmy.jpg "Jack on Remmy")

I'm a soon-to-be alumnus of Virginia Tech's Geography MS program and the [Near Earth Imaging Lab](https://www.nearearthimaginglab.org). As of September 2021, I have fulfilled all degree requirements, and have only to wait until commencment to officially graduate. I'm currently searching for employment, so if you are looking for a talented young remote sensing or geospatial analyst, I'm your man!

Currrently, I'm living in my hometown of Charleston, South Carolina. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my first love, the water, singing with my church choir, or gettting lost somewhere in the marsh or the forest.
